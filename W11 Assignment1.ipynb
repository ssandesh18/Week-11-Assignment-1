    "Q1. What is the Probability density function?\n",
    "A function that defines the relationship between a random variable and its probability, such that you can find the probability of the variable using the function, is called a Probability Density Function (PDF) in statistics.\n",

    "Types of Probability Distribution\n",
    "There are two types of probability distribution which are used for different purposes and various types of the data generation process.\n",

    "2.\tBinomial or Discrete Probability Distribution\n",

    "Q4. What are the properties of Binomial distribution? Give two examples of events where binomial distribution can be applied.\n",
    "Binomial Probability Distribution\n",
    "In binomial probability distribution, the number of ‘Success’ in a sequence of n experiments, where each time a question is asked for yes-no, then the boolean-valued outcome is represented either with success/yes/true/one (probability p) or failure/no/false/zero (probability q = 1 − p). A single success/failure test is also called a Bernoulli trial or Bernoulli experiment, and a series of outcomes is called a Bernoulli process. For n = 1, i.e. a single experiment, the binomial distribution is a Bernoulli distribution. The binomial distribution is the base for the famous binomial test of statistical importance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Negative Binomial Distribution\n",
    "In probability theory and statistics, the number of successes in a series of independent and identically distributed Bernoulli trials before a particularised number of failures happens. It is termed as the negative binomial distribution. Here the number of failures is denoted by ‘r’. For instance, if we throw a dice and determine the occurrence of 1 as a failure and all non-1’s as successes. Now, if we throw a dice frequently until 1 appears the third time, i.e., r = three failures, then the probability distribution of the number of non-1s that arrived would be the negative binomial distribution.\n",
    "Binomial Distribution Examples\n",
    "As we already know, binomial distribution gives the possibility of a different set of outcomes. In real life, the concept is used for:\n",
    "•\tFinding the quantity of raw and used materials while making a product.\n",
    "•\tTaking a survey of positive and negative reviews from the public for any specific product or place.\n",
    "•\tBy using the YES/ NO survey, we can check whether the number of persons views the particular channel.\n",
    "•\tTo find the number of male and female employees in an organisation.\n",
    "•\tThe number of votes collected by a candidate in an election is counted based on 0 or 1 probability.\n",

    "A normal distribution is symmetric from the peak of the curve, where the mean is. This means that most of the observed data is clustered near the mean, while the data become less frequent when farther away from the mean. The resultant graph appears as bell-shaped where the mean, median, and mode are of the same values and appear at the peak of the curve.\n",
